## Contributing

If you want to add something or want someone to add something, make an issue.

If you want to contribute, fork the repo and make a pull request. 

If you have no idea what you're doing, you want to google something along the lines of `git guide`, `github guide`, if you want to contribute but don't want to make an account or are too much of a windows brainlet to use git, you can zip up your changes and post that in the thread.
